Aquiclude
    Sometime refered to as an *aquifuge*;
    a rock with very low hydraulic conductivity that acts as an impermeable barrier to groundwater flow.

Aquifer
    A body of permerable rock that is capable of storing significant quantities of water,
    underlain by impermeable material.
     
Aquitard
    A rock with low values of hydraulic conductivity, but that still allows some flow of groundwater through it.

Artisan Well
    A well that flows without pumping
    because the hydraulic head in the {term}`confined aquifer<Confined Aquifer>` that feeds it is greater than that at ground level.

Confined Aquifer
    An aquifer that is sealed by impermeable rock above and below.

Discharge
    The amount of water flowing at a particular point.

Infiltration
    The downward entry of water into soil.  

Percolation
    The downward movement of water through soil.

Porosity
    The total sum of all void spaces in a rock. Often expressed as a percentage, or a number between 1 and 0. Not all these spaces may be connected, however, so for water flow, the *effective porosity* is the amount of void space that can hold and transmit water.

Recharge
    The downward movement of water from the soil to the {term}`water table<Water Table>`.
    
Residence time
    The time that a given substance remains in a particular reservoir in a biogeochemical cycle. 

Unconfined Aquifer
    An aquifer where the {term}`water table<Water Table>` defines the upper water limit.  

Water Footprint
    The total amount of water it takes to manufacture something.

Water Table
    The upper surface of groundwater, or the level below which an {term}`unconfined aquifer<Aquifer>` is permamently saturated with water.
