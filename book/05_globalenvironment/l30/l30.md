# Atmospheric heat transport

In this section, we will describe the mechanisms leading to poleward heat transport in the atmosphere and develop a simple model to predict the equilibrium temperature distribution. While the mean meridional circulation in the atmosphere (e.g. the Hadley circulation) is capable of transporting heat, most of the heat transport in the atmosphere is associated with \textit{transient} features.

The thermal wind balance introduced in the previous section is a state of equilibrium; the force exerted by the hydrostatic pressure gradient is balanced by the Coriolis acceleration. This equilibrium is \textit{unstable}. Imagine starting with an east/west jet in thermal wind balance with the mean temperature gradient. Because the wind is in a state of equilibrium, it will be steady ($\partial \mathbf{u}/\partial t=\mathbf{0}$). However, because the equilibrium is unstable, if we give this perturb this equilibrium state by a small amount, the perturbation will grow. As a result, the east/west jet will develop meanders, some of which will eventually develo into closed eddies. These are the weather systems that bring us periods of wet and dry weather.

\end{figure}

As air parcels are transported by meandering jets and eddies, they trace out chaotic trajectories. For example, Figure \ref{fig:lagrangian_trajectories} shows trajectories of small dust particles from a source in western China, inferred from a forecast model. Notice how the collection of particles spreads out as they travel to the east. This process is important for dispersing dust, aerosols, and pollutants.

The chaotic motion induced by transient eddies also transports heat. The motion of individual air parcels due to eddying motion is akin to a random walk. When an air parcel encounters an eddy, it might be advected to the north or to the south with some probability. Taking the analogy one step further, the collective effect of eddying motions on the concentration of a scalar field can be modelled using a diffusion equation. 

Consider the following model for the vertically and longitudinally averaged atmospheric temperature, $T$:
\begin{equation}
C_a\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = I(y) - O(y,T) + C_a\kappa \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2}.
\label{eq:diffusive_model_form}
\end{equation}
Here, $y$ is the distance (in meters) measured north from the Equator and $t$ is time\footnote{To be quantitatively precise, we would normally write this equation in spherical coordinates. This would make the equation more complicated and more difficult to solve, so here we opt for a simpler approximate form.}. This second order partial differential equation is a forced diffusion equation (sometimes called the heat equation). The forcing terms, $I$ and $O$ represent the net incoming shortwave and outgoing longwave radiative forcing. The units of $I$ and $O$ will be in $\mbox{W}/\mbox{m}^2$, and $C_a$ is the heat capcity of a vertical column of atmosphere. Recall that the heat capacity of air is about 1000 J/kg/$^\circ$ C and the mass of the atmosphere is about $10^4$ kg/m$^2$. Therefore, $C_a\simeq 10^7$ J/m$^2$/$^\circ$C.

\label{fig:CESM_fluxes}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:CESM_fluxes} shows profiles of the incoming shortwave and outgoing longwave radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. Here, we we assume that the incoming shortwave flux is a function of latitude only. Inspired by Fig.\ \ref{fig:CESM_fluxes}, we could take
\begin{equation}
I(y)=C(1+\cos{\frac{2y}{R_e}})+D,
\end{equation}
where $R_e$ is the radius of the Earth and $Q_{max}$ is the maximum incoming solar radiation (which occurs at the equator ($y=0$)). The argument to the $\cos$ function is set so that this term vanishes at the poles where $y=\pm \pi R_e/2$. Based on Figure \ref{fig:CESM_fluxes}, the difference between the incoming shortwave radiation at the equator and poles is about 250 W/m$^2$, so we take $C=125$ W/$m^2$. The global average of the incoming shortwave radiation is about 240 W/m$^2$, so we take $D=115$ W/m$^2$. Note from comparison with Fig.\ \ref{fig:CESM_fluxes} that this value makes the incoming shorwave radiation too high, but this is needed to yield the correct mean value while accounting for the fact that the equatorial region has a larger surface area per degree latitude than the polar regions. We could also include time-dependence in $I$ to represent seasons, but here $I$ instead represents an idealized annual average. 

Recall from the atmospheric chemistry lectures that the outgoing longwave radiation depends on the atmospheric temperature. It is important to account for this if we want to create a model that is capable of capturing climate states that are different to the one that we are currently experiencing. A simple way to represent the temperature dependence on the outgoing longwave radiation is using a linear function:
\begin{equation}
O(y,T)=A + B T.
\end{equation}
Reasonable values for the constants are $A=210 \mbox{W}/\mbox{m}^2$ and $B=2 \mbox{W}/\mbox{m}^2/^\circ \mbox{C}$.

Combining these terms, Eq.\ \ref{eq:diffusive_model_form} becomes
\begin{equation}
C_a \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = C(1+\cos{\frac{2y}{R_e}})+(D-A)-BT + C_a \kappa \frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial y^2}.
\label{eq:diffusive_model}
\end{equation}
We can think of the last term in Eq.\ \ref{eq:diffusive_model} as the divergence of a flux,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\kappa \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right),
\end{equation}
where the term in parenthesis is the north/south heat flux. An important aspect of the heat flux is that it always transports heat \textit{downgradient} so that heat is transfered from relatively warm regions (i.e. the tropics) towards relatively cool regions (i.e. the poles). Therefore, while the the net radiative heating/cooling acts to warm the equatorial regions and cool the polar regions, the heat flux acts to make the global temperature more uniform. An alternative approach inspired by this idea would be to replace the diffusion term in Eq.\ \ref{eq:diffusive_model} with a term like $-\gamma (T-\overline{T})$ where $\overline{T}$ is the global mean temperature. A term of this form (with $\gamma>0$) will cause the temperature to `relax' towards the global mean on a timescale of $1/\gamma$.

Now, let's consider the possible steady state solutions to Eq.\ \ref{eq:diffusive_model}. Since we are removing the time dependence, the equilibrium temperature, $T_e$, depends only on latitude and hence the equation changes from a partial differential equation for $T(y,t)$ to an ordinary differential equation for $T_e(y)$: Eq.\
\ref{eq:diffusive_model_form} becomes
\begin{equation}
A(1+\cos{\frac{2y}{R_e}})+(B-C)-DT_e + C_a \kappa \frac{d ^2 T_e}{d y^2}=0.
\label{eq:equilibrium_temperature_eq}
\end{equation}
Since this is a second order ODE, we need two boundary conditions. One choice is to ensure that the heat flux vanishes at the poles which requires that
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}= 0, \quad @ \quad y=-90^\circ, 90^\circ.
\end{equation}
Based on this boundary condition and the form of Eq.\ \ref{eq:equilibrium_temperature_eq}, we might guess that the solution will be of the form
\begin{equation}
T_e=\alpha + \beta \cos{\frac{2y}{R_e}}.
\label{eq:equilibrium_temperature_form}
\end{equation}
Notice that this form for $T_e$ always satsfies our boundary conditions. All that is left is to plug it into Eq.\ \ref{eq:equilibrium_temperature_eq} and find $\alpha$ and $\beta$. After re-arranging terms, we have
\begin{equation}
(C+D-A-\alpha B) + (C- B\beta - \frac{4}{R_e^2}C_a \kappa \beta)\cos{\frac{2y}{R_e}} = 0.
\end{equation}
Since this equation must hold for all values of $y$ (including $y=90^\circ$ where $\cos{y}=0$), the terms in both sets of parentheses must both vanish. Hence, we find that
\begin{equation}
\alpha=\frac{C+D-A}{B}, \quad \mbox{and} \quad \beta = \frac{C}{B+4C_a \kappa/R_e^2}.
\end{equation}
From Eq.\ \ref{eq:equilibrium_temperature_form}, we see that the equator to pole temperature difference is proportional to $\beta$. When $\kappa$ increases, $\beta$ will decrease, consistent with our intuition above that diffusion will tend to make the temperature more uniform.

In order to estimate the equilibrium temperature distribution, we still need to specify the diffusivity, $\kappa$, the units of which are L/T$^2$. We can estimate $\kappa$ as the product of characteristic velocity and length scales, $\kappa=U*L$. A typical wind speed associated with weather systems in the troposhere is $U\sim 5\mbox{m}/\mbox{s}$, while a typical eddy size is $L\sim 1000\mbox{km}$. Hence $\kappa \sim 5\times 10^6 \mbox{m}^2/\mbox{s}$.

\end{figure}

From the estimates above, we have $\alpha\simeq 15^\circ C$ and $\beta\simeq 18^\circ C$. Figure \ref{fig:diffusion_model_temp} shows the equilibrium temperature from Eq.\ \ref{eq:equilibrium_temperature_form} with these constants. Comparing this with the Earth's mean temperature in Fig.\ \ref{fig:equilibrium_temperature}, the diffusive model gives a reasonable equilibrium temperature distribution.
