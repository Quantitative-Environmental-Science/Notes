# Introduction

There are three lectures taking us to the end of Michaelmas term.

(section-label)=
## Lecture 22 - Aerosols
This lecture describes the basic characteristics of atmospheric particulate matter, such as formation processes, sources, removal processes, chemical composition, and size distribution.
It also outlines kinetic processes determining heterogenous reaction rates, and the describes the resistance model for uptake of gases into the condensed phase (particles and droplets).

## Lecture 23 - Air pollution and climate: direct effects
This lecture introduces health impacts of aerosols, how effects are linked with chemical composition and size, and what are the main methodologies to assess health impacts (toxicology vs. epidemiology approaches).
It also describes the direct effects that aerosols have on climate, through scattering and absorbing radiation.

## Lecture 24 - Air pollution and climate: indirect effects
This lecture describes how aerosols affect climate through their interaction with clouds.
It introduces the role of aerosols in cloud formation, the Koehler theory and rate of droplet growth.
It introduces also the role of aerosols in modifying cloud properties such as cloud optical thickness, lifetime, and albedo.
