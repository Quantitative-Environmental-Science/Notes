# Lecture 21: The chemistry of pollutants

```{rubric} Oxidation, phase-transitions, steady-state burdens
```
The chemistry of pollutants: During this lecture we will review the mechanism of loss of pollutants in the atmosphere. This occurs there four main routes: gas-phase oxidation, heterogeneous uptake, photolysis and gas-to-aerosol partitioning. We will calculate how these different processes impact the lifetime of a pollutant and calculate the steady state burden of NO2.

```{highlights}
Aims:
1. To describe the rates of changes of pollutants in the atmosphere through different processes.
2. To calculate the steady state burden of a pollutant in the atmosphere.
3. To calculate how the steady state will change under different conditions.

Key points:

- Constituents in the atmosphere can undergo (pseudo)first order decay and second order decay.
- Photolysis is an example of first order decay that is important for photolabile molecules like NO2.
- The steady state of represents the concentration of a species when its rates of production and loss are balanced.
- Chemical kinetics allows us to predict how the steady state will change.

## Rates of change in the atmosphere

If we have a chemical species, A, that is lost via a _process_ in the atmosphere, we can plot the change in its concentration as a function of time:

We can represent the loss of A in this situation as:

The greater the magnitude of _k_, the "faster" the loss of A.

Rather than just observing how A will change we can solve the equation above to calculate [A]t.

Given that _k_ is a constant we can then write:

and

We can use this graph and the equations above to define the **time constant** (_ **** _ as the time taken for the concentration of _A_ to be reduced by 1/eth of its value.

The smaller this time constant the greater the loss of _A_ with time and hence the shorter its **lifetime**.

The example above holds for the case where [A]t is independent of factors other than k. This occurs through many processes but not all.

Consider the slightly more complex reaction:

On first glance we _ **expect** _ this to be a second order process (first order in _A_ and first order in _B_ so second order overall). However, if the concentration of [_B_] doesn't change much over time (for example because _B_ is present in large excess) then we can make the approximation that , which allows us to consider _A_ as undergoing _pseudo-first order_ kinetics ([_B_]~ constant and so it can be folded into our second order rate constant (_k__2_) to yield a pseudo-first order rate constant, _k__2 __'=k__ 2_[_B_]). The time constant for A is now given by:

__ = 1/_k2_[_B_] = 1/_k2'_.

More complex again, what about a chain reaction:

where _A_ is our initial reactant, _B_ an intermediate product and _C_ the final product of the reaction. Following the same procedure as above we can write:

Solutions for these equations for _k__1_= 1(s-1) and _k__2_= 2 (s-1) are shown below.

![](figures/figure2.png)

For the case where _k__1_= 1 (s-1) and _k__2_= 10 (s-1) we have:

![](figures/figure3.png)

What you will notice from the figures above is that the intermediate _B_ is short lived relative to _C_ and that as the value for _k __2_increases the peak concentration of _B_ decreases. The time it takes for B to reach an almost steady concentration is ~ _1/k__ 2_. In the limit where we can make the approximation:

where the subscript _ss_ is used to note that we are considering the intermediate B to be in **steady state**.

Following this through, we can re-write the remaining equations which describe our complex reaction (making the substitution [_B_]ss=_k__1_[A]_/k__2_):

In doing so we have greatly reduced the complexity of this reaction system.

In the atmosphere there are many examples of compounds that can be considered to be in steady state.

## Examples of first order decay

Photolysis is a good example of first order decay. Here the rate of change of our species (say NO2) is dependent on the photolysis coefficient. This depends on the flux of photons from the sun, the absorption cross section of NO2 and its quantum yield. The main challenge is to calculate (see Lecture 23).

The rate of a heterogeneous process is usually expressed in terms of the uptake coefficient **,**  **** , which is defined as the fraction of molecules colliding with the surface that are permanently lost from the gas phase.

According to the kinetic theory of gases, the rate of collision of a species A at the surface, per unit area, is [A].c/4, where [A] is the concentration (molecules cm-3) of species A and c the mean molecular speed of the gas molecules ( = (8RT/M)1/2).

The rate of removal of molecules at the surface can therefore be expressed as a first-order process with rate:

S is the surface area of the atmospheric particles (NB per unit volume of gas, often called the surface area density and has units of e.g. cm2 cm-3). As well as providing data on the rate of removal of trace gases by aerosol particles, uptake coefficient measurements can be used to deduce the mechanisms of the heterogeneous processes.

## Examples of pseudo-first order decay

Many trace gases in the atmosphere are approximately constant in concentration with time. An example is the hydroxyl radical OH, whose concentration is roughly 106 molecules cm-3 during the day. OH acts as the main detergent in the atmosphere reacting with almost all the other trace gases and pollutants that are emitted into the air. For example:

NO2 + OH + M ®HNO3 + M

In this reaction the concentration of M is unaffected but the concentration of OH is reduced. However, there is a sufficiently large source of OH such that it has no impact on the [OH] so that we can write:

We can make use of this to predict the concentration of NO2 (or HNO3):

Where

## Steady state calculations

In the example above we have implicitly made the assumption that [OH] is in the steady state. Steady state was introduced in the chain reaction at the start of the lecture (and in 1A Chemical Kinetics). Steady state is an important approximation we often make use of in the atmosphere. Many pollutants are in steady state because their chemical loss processes are fast. How fast do they need to be? It depends over what time scale we are interested in. As we say in the last lecture [NO2] has changed a lot over the last 165 years. However, day to day we say that the [NO2] was fairly similar. During the COVID pandemic what caused the large decrease in [NO2] was a change in its emissions (source) rather than a change in its loss (sink).
