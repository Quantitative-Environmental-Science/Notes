# Introduction

Friday November 18th - Lecture 19 – An overview of the atmosphere: During this lecture we will review the structure (layers) of the atmosphere.^
We will use physical principles to determine how mass changes and why.
We will review what causes variations in temperature in the atmosphere and the important role that ozone plays.
We will review the most important radiatively active gases/aerosols in the atmosphere.

Monday November 21st - Lecture 20 – Air pollution: During this lecture we will define what comprises air pollution.
We will identify the main air pollutants as nitrogen dioxide ($\mathrm{NO_2}$) and particulate matter (PM) and look at their sources and sinks.
We will review historical trends and the current distribution as viewed in situ and from space (through application of the Beer-Lambert law).

Wednesday November 23rd - Lecture 21 – The chemistry of pollutants: During this lecture we will review the mechanism of loss of pollutants in the atmosphere.
This occurs through four main routes: gas-phase oxidation, heterogeneous uptake, photolysis and gas-to-aerosol partitioning.
We will calculate how these different processes impact the lifetime of a pollutant and calculate the steady state burden of $\mathrm{NO_2}$.
