# The Biological Pump

The surface ocean is a soup of microscopic life - one ml of average surface ocean water contains around 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> organisms (and [that estimate](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578) only includes prokaryotes!).
Many of these organisms are photosynthetic phytoplankton, the 'plants of the sea', which harvest light energy from the sun to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into sugars.
These are the 'primary producers' of the ocean, and are the base of the marine food web.
Here, we'll look at how the carbon trapped by these organisms is exported from the surface ocean to the deep, removing carbon from the atmosphere and concentrating it in the ocean.

## Phytoplankton

Phytoplankton are present everywhere in the surface ocean, but their abundance is not uniform ({numref}`fig:carbon:chla`).
Patterns in their abundance are driven by the availability of the two key components required for growth: light and nutrients.
However, phytoplankton are extremely diverse, with numerous adaptations to living in inhospitable areas of the ocean: the 'marine deserts' in the subtropical gyres have a healthy population of particularly small phytoplankton that are specially adapted for living in these nutrient-poor waters, and some phytoplankton that live in polar oceans are specially adapted to survive the long winters, with almost no light for ~6 months.
Phytoplankton are found *everywhere* in the surface ocean, but their abundance and productivity varies greatly.

Phytoplankton fuel a complex food web of zooplankton ({numref}`fig:carbon:plankton`), fish, and ultimately all marine life.
However, for the purposes of understanding ocean carbon, we're going to compress all this complexity to consider 'organic matter' - solid material that makes up the bodies of marine organisms that is created from dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> and light by phytoplankton.
All organisms eventually die, and their organic matter gradually sinks from the surface into the deep ocean.

## Organic Matter

Organic matter is produced by phytoplankton from dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean, and can be approximated as:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:phot_glucose
\mathrm{\underbrace{6 CO_2}_{carbon~dioxide} + \underbrace{6 H_2O}_{water} \xrightarrow[+light]{photosynthesis} \underbrace{C_6H_{12}O_6}_{glucose} + \underbrace{6 O_2}_{oxygen}}
```

This describes the process of **primary productivity** in its most basic form: the capture of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by photosynthesis, and the production of glucose, a simple sugar, which can fuel biological processes in organisms.
However, because CO<sub>2</sub> is ubiquitously present in the surface ocean, this equation predicts that photosynthesis should be capturing carbon from the atmosphere *everywhere* that there is light.
We can see from {numref}`fig:carbon:chla` that this is not the case, with large regions of low productivity in the subtropical gyres, where there is abundant light.
This is because the availability of nutrients is a key driver of phytoplankton abundance, and the availability of nutrients is not uniform in the ocean.

### Nutrients

To consider the limiting effect of nutrients, we must use a more complete (but still very approximate) definition of organic matter:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:phot_organic
\mathrm{\underbrace{106 CO_2}_{carbon~dioxide} + \underbrace{16 NO_3 + H_3PO_4}_{nutrients} + 78 H_2O + 18H^+ \xrightarrow[+light]{photosynthesis} \underbrace{C_{106}H_{175}O_{42}N_{16}P}_{organic~matter} + \underbrace{150 O_2}_{oxygen}}
```

Here, we include the **macronutrients** nitrogen and phosphorous alongside carbon, which are two of the main limiting nutrients in the ocean.
An interesting characteristic of organic matter is that it contains C:N:P in a relatively consistent 106:16:1 ratio, which is known as the **Redfield Ratio** ({numref}`fig:carbon:redfield`).

```{figure} figures/carbon-redfield.webp

The dissolved concentations of N and P in the ocean show a consistent 16:1 slope, corresponding to the concentration of these elements in average organic matter.
```

Nutrients will be consumed in proportion to their abundance in organic matter ({numref}`fig:carbon:limitation`) wherever there is light available to power photosynthesis.
This means that, with the exception for the polar oceans where light can be limiting, the patterns of primary productivity are determined by nutrient supply.
The mechanisms that supply N and P to the ocean are very different.

**Phosphate** (PO<sub>4</sub>) is derived from the dissolution of rocks on the continents.
Consequently, it must either be supplied either via rivers, or by wind-blown dust, primarily from deserts (dust from the Sahara is regularly found in Central America!).

**Nitrate** (NO<sub>3</sub>) is also supplied from the continents, but the atmosphere provides a second significant source.
Nitrogen is the most abundant element in the atmosphere, which is 78% N<sub>2</sub>, but this form of nitrogen is not available for use by phytoplankton.
Specialised groups of phytoplankton have evolved the ability to reduce dissolved N<sub>2</sub> into forms that can be used by other phytoplankton, in a process known as **nitrogen fixation**.

A third source of both N and P to the surface ocean is the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water, which recycles nutrients from the deep ocean back to the surface.
We'll discuss why the deep ocean is enriched in nutrients below.

Consequently, elements below this line (e.g. Fe, Mn, Co) are rapidly consumed by phytoplankton, which gives the ma very short residence time in the ocean compared to abundant ions that are not limiting (e.g. Mg, K, S). From [Moore et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo1765).
```

```{admonition} Micronutrients...
:class: dropdown

It is worth noting that N and P are not the only nutrients that limit phytoplankton growth ({numref}`fig:carbon:limitation`).
There are large areas of the ocean where they are abundant, but **micronutrients** such as iron, manganese, and cobalt, prevent phytoplankton from growing.
These patterns of limitation are largely a product of the patterns of the supply of micronutrients on the planet.

The Southern Ocean, for example, is relatively rich in N and P, but has low phytoplankton productivity compared to the Northern hemisphere.
This is predominantly driven by low iron concentrations in the Southern Ocean.
Iron is low because, like P, it is derived from the dissolution of rocks on the continents, but the antarctic circumpolar current has minimal contact with coastlines that can supply dissolved iron from rivers, and there are no desert regions in the path of the westerlies that blow towards antarctica to supply dust.

The patterns of micronutrient limitation are complex, and beyond the scope of this course.
Here, we'll only consider the effects of macronutrients on phytoplankton growth.

## The Biological Pump

The **Biological Pump** describes the transport of nutrients and carbon from the surface ocean to the deep ocean by sinking organic matter ({numref}`fig:carbon:biopump`).
This process is driven by the production of organic matter in the surface waters, which is broken down by bacteria and other organisms as it sinks through the ocean interior, **remineralising** the organic matter back into its dissolved constituents.
This increases the dissolved concentrations of carbon and nutrients in the deep ocean, which are then eventually returned to the surface by Thermohaline Circulation.

```

The process of organic matter breakdown is very efficient.
Only about 1% of the organic matter produced at the surface makes it all the way to the sediments at the bottom of the ocean.
The remaining 99% is broken down as it sinks through the water column, and is release as dissolved carbon and nutrients into the water.
In fact, remineralisation is so efficient that only ~15% of the organic matter produced in the surface ocean even makes it into the deep ocean - ~85% is broken down while it is still close to the surface!

However, the ocean is very large and thermohaline circulation is slow, so the biological pump drives a significant accumulation of nutrients and carbon in the deep ocean, which increases in concentration along the thermohaline circulation path ({numref}`fig:carbon:circulation`).

The (salinity-normalised) concentrations of PO<sub>4</sub> and DIC in the ocean interior along the Thermohaline Circulation path (red arrows). Notice how both PO<sub>4</sub> and DIC increase in deep water along the circulation path. This is because they receive a constant supply of nutrients from organic matter falling from the surface and remineralising in the deep water. This acts to concentration nutrients and DIC in the deep ocean, leading to nutrient-rich waters in upwelling zones. From [Sarmiento & Gruber (2006), Chapter 5](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400849079).
```

The biological pump provides an efficient one-way transport of nutrients and organic matter into the deep ocean, which causes the deep ocean to be significantly more enriched in DIC than we would expect based on {ref}`carbon:solubility` alone.

## Modelling the Biological Pump

To model the biological pump we must include a nutrient to limit biological productivity, and include the uptake and release of DIC and nutrients by photosynethsis and remineralisation.

### Adding a nutrient

For our model we will use Phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) as our limiting nutrient, which is related to DIC by the Redfield Ratio by:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:P-DIC
\DeltaDIC_{org} = 106 \DeltaP_{org}
```

Our model does not include sediments or continents, so we can model phosphate as a constant inventory which is partitioned between the ocean boxes by circulation and productivity.
We therefore model phosphate by adding phytoplankton consumption terms to the surface boxes, and remineralisation terms to the deep boxes (assuming that everything that leaves the surface box is remineralised in the deep box.
This modifies Eq. {eq}`eq:3box_conservative` to:

```{math}

```

### Coupling productivity and DIC.
