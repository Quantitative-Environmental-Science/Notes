# Ocean Carbon

This section of the course we will add `biogeochemistry' to the physical understanding of the oceans that you developed in the previous section.
We will show how physical, chemical and biological processes in the ocean play a central role in setting atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentrations.

In parallel with these lectures you will create a numerical model of carbon in the ocean, including all the processes we discuss.
