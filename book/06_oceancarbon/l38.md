# Calcification

Calcification - patterns, processes and products.

Limiting factors - saturation state, ocean acidification.

The carbonate pump - the role of calcifiers.

Ballasting

## Modelling Calcification

Calcification is biologically-mediated, and takes up CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup> from the surface ocean and exports it to the deep.
We will therefore model calcification as a function of biological productivity in the surface ocean, assuming that some fixed fraction of biological carbon export ($F_{calc}$) is accompanied by calcification:

```{math}
F_{calc} = \frac{CO_{3,calc}^{2-}}{DIC_{org}}
```

The amount of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> exported from a surface box is therefore given by:

```{math}
\dv{CO_{3,i}^{2-}}{t} = F_{calc,i} \underbrace{106 \frac{V_i}{\tau^P_i} P_i}_{biological~C~export}
```

This term modifies both DIC and TA in our model. DIC is modified following:

```{math}
:label: eq:3box:dic:calc
\dv{DIC_L}{t} &= \left( \text{[...]} - F_{calc,L} 106 \frac{V_L}{\tau^P_L} P_L \right) / V_L \\
\dv{DIC_H}{t} &= \left( \text{[...]} - F_{calc,H} 106 \frac{V_L}{\tau^P_H} P_H \right) / V_H \\
\dv{DIC_D}{t} &= \left( \text{[...]} + F_{calc,L} 106 \frac{V_L}{\tau^P_L} P_L + F_{calc,H} 106 \frac{V_H}{\tau^P_H} P_H \right) / V_D
```

where \text{[...]} represents the thermohaline circulation, vertical mixing and biological production terms in {eq}`eq:3box:dic:biopump`. TA is modified following:

```{math}
:label: eq:3box:ta:calc
\dv{TA_L}{t} &= \left( \text{[...]} - 2 F_{calc,L} 106 \frac{V_L}{\tau^P_L} P_L \right) / V_L \\
\dv{TA_H}{t} &= \left( \text{[...]} - 2 F_{calc,H} 106 \frac{V_L}{\tau^P_H} P_H \right) / V_H \\
\dv{TA_D}{t} &= \left( \text{[...]} + 2 F_{calc,L} 106 \frac{V_L}{\tau^P_L} P_L + 2 F_{calc,H} 106 \frac{V_H}{\tau^P_H} P_H \right) / V_D
```

where \text{[...]} represents the thermohaline circulation and vertical mixing terms in {eq}`eq:3box:conservative`.
