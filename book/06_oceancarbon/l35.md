# How much carbon is in the ocean?

```{rubric} Tracers in the sea: Ocean movement and biogeochemistry.
```

<!-- ## Plan

- Ocean contains ~40x carbon in atmosphere.
- Ocean-atmosphere exchange is rapid (~110 Gt/yr), or ~15x anthropogenic release.
- Small changes in these fluxes can have BIG implications for atmospheric CO2

- Ocean takes up ~1/3 carbon (pCO2 vs. O2/N2 plot) we release
- Uptake is not uniform - some areas release CO2, others take up CO2 - NET must be uptake
- Patterns are combination of physical, chemical and biological processes.

- Physical processes:
  - circulation
  - deep storage and 'ventilation' - need for surface/deep split

- Chemical processes:
  - dissolution of CO2, reaction with water
  - speciation depends on temp (thermodynamics) & sal (non-ideal solution)
  - temp varies along circulation path - need for hilat/lolat split

- Biological processes:
  - uptake of C by life, which sinks to depth
  - limited by light, nutrients
  - calcification _releases_ CO2, but can have complex interactions with biology.

- Next three lectures will go through chemical, biological, calcification in some detail, showing how they are parameterised in the ocean carbon model you will make in the practicals.
- Final lecture will examine some patterns in this model and think about the role of oceans in future.

```{highlights}
Key Points:
- Chemicals in the ocean are heterogenerously distributed.
- Ocean circulation, chemistry and biology interact to drive a disequilibrium between the atmosphere and average ocean composition.
- A three-box model is sufficient to understand these patterns.

## Why are the oceans important for carbon?

The oceans are large - around 71% of the area of the Earth, with an average depth of 3.7 km.
They are also dense, with a total mass of 1.426 x10<sup>21</sup> kg.
This is around 300 times more massive than the atmosphere (5.148 x10<sup>18</sup> kg).
The oceans also contain a lot that isn't water - both solid materials and atmospheric gasses dissolve into the ocean, such that it contains every stable element on the periodic table.
The exchange of gasses between the ocean at the atmosphere, combined with the relatively large mass of the ocean, make it a significant influence on atmospheric composition, and particularly the concentration of carbon ($pCO_2$).

### How much carbon is in the ocean?

The only way carbon can move between the ocean and atmosphere is by the exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules.
A good starting point for estimating the amount of carbon in the ocean might therefore be to assume that the ocean is in equilibrium with atmospheric $pCO_2$.
The exchange of molecules between gas and liquid is described by **Henry's Law**, which states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas in the liquid:

```{math}
C = k P
```

where $C$ is the concentration of the gas in the liquid, $k$ is the solubility constant, and $P$ is the partial pressure of the gas in the atmosphere. For CO<sub>2</sub>, this is given by:

```{math}
[CO_2] = K_0\ pCO_2
```

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
[CO_2] &= \mu mol\ kg^{-1} \\
pCO_2 &= \text{parts per million (ppm)} \\
K_0 &= \mu mol\ kg^{-1}\ ppm^{-1}
$$
```

where $K_0$ is the solubility constant for CO<sub>2</sub> in water, and $pCO_2$ is the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, and square brackets denote the concentration of a dissolved chemical species.

A typical value of $K_0$ is 0.03 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup> ppm<sup>-1</sup>, which at modern atmospheric $pCO_2$ of ~400 ppm gives a dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 12 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup>.
Accounting for the mass of the ocean, this gives a total dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 1.7 x10<sup>16</sup> moles, or 205.3 GtC (1 Gt = 10<sup>15</sup>g) in the global ocean.

Another way to estimate the amount of carbon in the ocean is to physically measure the carbon concentration in the ocean.





This is considerably less carbon than is present in the atmosphere (~750 GtC), and _much_ less carbon that we know is stored in the global oceans (~37,900 GtC, {numref}`fig:carbonreservoirs`).
We know there is a lot more carbon in the ocean than predicted by Henry's Law because of global efforts to measure carbon concentrations throughout the ocean.

If we turn this calculation around, around we find that atmospheric $pCO_2$ would be ~78,000 ppm if the atmosphere were in equilibrium with an ocean containing 37,900 GtC as CO<sub>2</sub>. 
These back-of-the-envelope calculations show us that the ocean and atmosphere are out of equilibrium, and that the ocean contains significantly more carbon than we expect it to.
