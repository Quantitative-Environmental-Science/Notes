Key Points:
- The model we have made in this section is a minimal representation of the ocean carbon cycle.
- We have approximated many important processes using characteristic timescale parameters ($\tau$).
- These $\tau$ values are independent of the state of the model, which is not realistic.
- Adding these dependencies allows us to explore the importance of these interactions for the future ocean carbon cycle.
- Here, we look at how you might investigate the impact of ocean acidification in this model.
- You will do something similar for your Lab Report!

## A Model Ocean

The model we have put together in this section ({numref}`fig:carbon:3box-labels`) does a decent job of representing the state of the ocean carbon cycle.
However, it is a gross over-simplification of the real ocean, with only three boxes and with all the key processes governed by relatively few key parameters that are independent of the state of the model ({numref}`tab:carbon:3box-labels`).

As we have seen in our consideration of {ref}`carbon:solubility`, {ref}`carbon:biopump` and {ref}`carbon:calcification`, there are good reasons for the processes behind these simple timescale parameters to be sensitive to the state of the model ({numref}`tab:carbon:3box-labels`).
If we want to use our model to explore the impact of future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the ocean carbon cycle, we must add some of these dependencies to our model.

### Model Evolution

The process of model development we are following here is very similar to how climate models have evolved in the last few decades.
The 3-box model we have made is inspired by a model developed by [Sarmiento & Toggweiler in 1984](https://doi.org/10.1038/308621a0), who used it to propose that observed 70ppm pCO<sub>2</sub> changes observed in ice cores over glacial-interglacial cycles were driven by changes in high-latitude ocean productivity.
This simple model was sufficient to consider first-order questions about 'why did pCO<sub>2</sub> change by 70ppm between the ice ages?', as it was able to demonstrate the sensitivity of pCO<sub>2</sub> to regime shifts in ocean mixing and productivity.

In the modern world, we are concerned with how the ocean will respond to the anthropogenic release of CO<sub>2</sub> and consequent warming.
Global emissions stand at around 8 PgC yr<sup>-1</sup>, about 4 PgC yr<sup>-1</sup> of this remains in the atmosphere, and the ocean takes up 2.3±0.7 PgC yr<sup>-1</sup>.
Small changes in how carbon is partitioned between the ocean and the atmosphere could have a substantial impact on the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> increase in the atmosphere.
The three-box model with independent processes that we have developed is too coarse to accurately answer these questions.
We need a model that represents the interaction ocean processes and the geographic variability of the ocean in much more detail to precisely tackle these questions.

The need for precision in these estimates has led to the development of increasingly complex climate models, which have evolved by extending the same conceptual approach that we have used to build our simple model.
They have simply added more boxes to represent spatial differences in the atmosphere, land and ocean, included more processes that move heat and chemicals around the planet, and parameterised some of the state-dependence of these processes, and the interactions between them.

The end result is a variety of Global Climate Models (GCMs) that are used to simulate the climate of the Earth, and to predict how it will change in the future.
Ultimately, these models are still just a set of equations that represent the processes that drive the climate system, and the parameters that control those processes, just like the model we have developed.

## Modelling Ocean Acidification

For the rest of this section, we will explore one example of how we might extend our simple model to include the impact of ocean acidification on the export of CaCO<sub>3</sub> from the surface ocean.

### Ocean Acidification

Ocean acidification has so far come up in two places: in {ref}`carbon:solubility` we saw that {ref}`increasing pCO2 decreases ocean pH <carbon:solubility:ocean-acidification>`, and when discussing {ref}`carbon:calcification` we saw that ocean acidification {ref}`reduces the saturation state of seawater<carbon:calcification:ocean-acidification>`.

Ocean acidification has the potential to impact both the production of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the surface ocean, and how much of the CaCO<sub>3</sub> produced is dissolved in the surface before it is exported to the deep ocean.

### Modelling Ocean Acidification

The amount of CaCO<sub>3</sub> exported from the surface ocean is set as a fraction of organic matter export, $f_{calc}$.
At present this is set to 0.1 in the `hilat` box and 0.2 in the `lolat` box, which is an approximate reflection of the lower overall saturation state caused by the lower temperatures in the high-latitude surface ocean.
To model the impact of ocean acidification, we need to parameterise $f_{calc}$ so that CaCO<sub>3</sub> export is a function of the saturation state of the surface ocean.
To do this, we must consider the impact of saturation on both the formation and dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> ({numref}`fig:carbon:3box-acidification`).

#### Production

The impact of acidification on CaCO<sub>3</sub> formation rate is complex, because the entire surface ocean is currently highly supersaturated with respect to CaCO<sub>2</sub>.
Despite this, calcification rarely happens spontaneously because of the inhibitory effects of ions dissolved in seawater, and calcification is almost entirely biologcially mediated.

Numerous experiments have looked into the impact of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms, but the results are mixed.
It is likely that the rate of CaCO<sub>3</sub> formation will depend to some extent on the saturation state of the surface ocean, but there is evidently some a degree of decoupling between the rate of CaCO<sub>3</sub> formation and the saturation state of the surface ocean.
We will therefore assume that CaCO<sub>3</sub> production always occurs, with a dependence on the saturation state.
For example, we can write:

```{math}
f_{produced} = 0.05 \Omega
```

#### Dissolution

The rate of dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the surface ocean is a purely chemical process, and is a function of the saturation (Ω) of the waters.
Dissolution rate is commonly formulated as:

```{math}
\dv{\ce{CaCO_3}}{t} = [\ce{CaCO3}] k_{diss} \left( \Omega - 1 \right)^n
```

Where $k_{diss}$ is a rate constant and $n$ is an exponent that describes the reaction order of the process. for our purposes, we will assume that $n=1$.
From this, we can calculate the fraction of CaCO<sub>3</sub> produced in the surface layer that has not dissolved at the base of the surface layer ($f_{remaining}$) as:

```{math}
f_{remaining} = e^{k_{diss} t (\Omega - 1)}
```

Where $t$ is the amount of time for a sinking particle to reach the bottom of the surface layer. For this, we assume a particle sinking velocity of 10 m d<sup>-1</sup>, and use the surface layer thickness of 100 m for the `lolat` box and 200m for the `hilat` box.

This equation would predict that there is no dissolution in supersaturated surface waters, which we know is not the case because of localised low-saturation regions that are generated by microbial activity in sinking particles.
To account for this, we will assume that this local dissolution will effectively raise the ocean saturation state at which dissolution will begin, meaning that dissolution will begin when the surface water drops below a critical value of $\Omega_{crit}$.
Thus:

```{math}
f_{remaining} = \begin{cases}
e^{k_{diss} t (\Omega - \Omega_{crit})} & \mathrm{for~\Omega < \Omega_{crit}} \\
1 & \mathrm{for~\Omega > \Omega_{crit}} \\
\end{cases}
```

Where we will use an $\Omega_{crit}$ value of 3.

#### Export

The final fraction of CaCO<sub>3</sub> exported from the surface to the deep ocean, $f_{calc}$ is then:

```{math}
f_{calc} &= f_{produced} ~ f_{remaining} \\
&= \begin{cases}
0.05 \Omega ~ e^{k_{diss} t (\Omega - \Omega_{crit})} & \mathrm{for~\Omega < \Omega_{crit}} \\
0.05 \Omega & \mathrm{for~\Omega > \Omega_{crit}} \\
\end{cases}
```

```{admonition} Example Lab Report: Part 1
:class: tip, dropdown
Create a modified version of your model which includes the impact of ocean acidification on CaCO<sub>3</sub> export from the surface ocean (`f_CaCO3`). `f_CaCO3` should be a function of the saturation state of the surface ocean (Ω), which affects both the production of CaCO<sub>3</sub> and how much of the produced CaCO<sub>3</sub> is dissolved before it leaves the surface layer. 

Model CaCO<sub>3</sub> production associated with biological productivity as a linear function of Ω, `f_production = 0.05 Ω`. The fraction of this produced CaCO<sub>3</sub> that is exported from the surface ocean (`f_remaining`) should be calculated using an exponential decay function of the form `f_remaining = exp(k * t * (Omega - Omega_crit))`, where `k` is the dissolution rate constant, `t` is the time a sinking particle remains in the surface ocean, and `Omega_crit` is the saturation at which dissolution begins. Use values of `k = 0.07` d<sup>-1</sup> and `Omega_crit = 3`, which is greater than 1 to account for the impact of localised dissolution within sinking particles. To calculate the time it takes a sinking particle to reach the bottom of the surface layer, use a sinking velocity of 10 m d<sup>-1</sup>.
```

### Impact on Steady State Model

```{admonition} Example Lab Report: Part 2
:class: tip, dropdown
Initialise this model at the steady-state conditions of the unmodified model, and compare the evolution of the two models. Describe any significant differences and similarities.
```

If we have parameterised the impact of ocean acidification well, the modified model should be very similar to the unmodified model, which was already doing a good job of representing the system.
We would expect any changes that are present to be limited to the carbon chemistry of the model, as `f_CaCO3` only directly impacts TA and DIC in the model; it has no effect on temperature, salinity or nutrients.

In {numref}`fig:carbon:3box:OA:SS`, we can see the differences between the carbon system in the original model and the new model including the impact of ocean acidification.
The main difference is that `f_CaCO3` in the `hilat` box is higher in the new steady state than the old model (~0.175 cf. 0.1).
This increase in TA export from the `hilat` box drives a lower steady-state TA in that box, and a slight corresponding increase in the `deep` box.
Steady-state pCO<sub>2</sub> between the two models is very similar (396 in the new model, vs. 394 in the original).
Apart from this, the carbon system is very similar between the two models, indicating that the parameterisation of `f_CaCO3` is reasonable.
The steady state of the new model is reached within ~20 years of the start of the simulation.

### pCO<sub>2</sub> Release Experiment

```{admonition} Example Lab Report: Part 3
:class: tip, dropdown
Conduct a CO<sub>2</sub> release experiment, where 8 PgC yr<sup>-1</sup> is released into the atmosphere for 200~years (model years 400-600). Run the model for a total of 3000 years, and examine the evolution of pCO<sub>2</sub>, Ω, and CaCO<sub>3</sub> export over time compared to the unmodified model. Discuss the patterns you observe.
```

The similarities between the modified and unmodified models break down when we conduct a CO<sub>2</sub> release experiment, releasing 8 PgC yr<sup>-1</sup> into the atmosphere for 200 years between model years 400-600.

```{figure} figures/ocean-3box-OA-CO2-release.png

The horizontal dashed line in the Omega panel shows the value of `Omega_crit` where dissolution starts reducing the efficiency of CaCO<sub>3</sub> export from the surface ocean.
```

In {numref}`fig:carbon:3box:OA:CO2-release`, we can see that `f_CaCO3`, TA and DIC respond very differently in the modified vs. unmodified models during the emissions pulse.
The difference in `f_CaCO3` is consistent with our modification function, where we can see linear decreases until Omega drops below the critical value of 3, at which point `f_CaCO3` drops more rapidly as dissolution begins to dominate.
The change in `f_CaCO3` reduces the TA and DIC export associated with calcification, causing them both to be elevated in the surface ocean, and slightly depleted in the deep ocean.
This effect is much more visible in TA, where we would expect to see the largest effect.

After the emissions pulse, both models recover to a new steady-state value over a similarly long period, consistent with ocean mixing.
The new steady state has lower calcification, and consequently higher surface TA and DIC, than the original model.
In both cases, a large fraction of the emitted carbon ends up in the deep ocean.

The difference in pCO<sub>2</sub> between the models is subtle, but noticeable ({numref}`fig:carbon:3box:OA:CO2-comparison`).
Except for a short period in at the beginning of the model run where the modified model has a slightly higher pCO<sub>2</sub>, the model including the calcification feedback hasa lower pCO<sub>2</sub> than the unmodified model.
The maximum difference is at aroun 1150 years, where the modified model is ~20 ppm lower than the original model.
This minumum occurs at the same time as the Ω `lolat` box rises above three, and dissolution no longer has a strong influence on modifying `f_CaCO3`.
The steady-state pCO<sub>2</sub> ~15ppm lower than the unmodified model, consistent with the higher surface TA in the new model driven by reduced overall `f_CaCO3` in the new steady state.
These differences are small relative to the total pCO<sub>2</sub> in the model atmosphweres, but a difference of 15 ppm is equivalent to 6.5 years of anthropogenically-driven emissions (2.3 ppm yr<sup>-1</sup>)!

### Additional Factors

```{admonition} Example Lab Report: Part 4
:class: tip, dropdown
What additional factors might influence how these patterns manifest in the real ocean?
```

An important factor that might alter the patterns we see in the model is the effect of ballasting on the biological pump.
The ballasting hypothesis suggests that marine particles which contain more dense minerals will sink faster, increasing the efficiency of the biological pump and increasing the export of organic carbon from the surface ocean.
If this were the case, the reduced biological pump efficiency associated with ocean acidification might drive an increase in atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> that could offset some or all of the reduction in pCO<sub>2</sub> associated with the calcification feedback.

In our model, we could test this by adding a negative correlation between `f_CaCO3` and $\tau_P$, as greater ballasting driven by `f_CaCO3` would increase organic matter export rates and decrease the residence time of nutrients in the surface ocean.
