The majority of carbon (XX%) in the ocean exists as {term}`Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)<DIC>`.
In this lecture, we'll look at how carbon moves between the ocean and the atmosphere, and how dissolved $\mathrm{CO_2}$ and {term}`DIC` are related.
We'll then combine this chemical knowledge with what we know about ocean circulation to see whether it explains patterns in ocean-atmosphere $\mathrm{CO_2}$ fluxes.

## How does $\mathrm{CO_2}$ get into water?

<!-- - Ideal gasses dissolve into water following Henry's Law ($K_0$)
- Sensitive to temperature
  - Think: what happens as water changes temperature?
  - Refer back to CO2 patterns.
- Calculate DIC concentration from pCO2 with only $K_0$ -->

## $\mathrm{CO_2}$ reacts with water


Once CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, a diprotic acid that dissociates into three dissolved species:

```{math}
:label: eq:co2sw:dissociation
CO_{2(aq)} + H_2O \leftrightarrow \underbrace{H_2CO_3}_{carbonic~acid} \leftrightarrow \underbrace{HCO_3^-}_{bicarbonate} + H^+ \leftrightarrow \underbrace{CO_3^{2-}}_{carbonate} + 2H^+
```

and DIC is defined as:

```{math}
:label: eq:co2sw:dic
DIC &= [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}] \\
&= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}]
```

where $[CO_2^*]$ is used in place of the first two species because carbonic acid is functionally absent at normal seawater pH - as soon as CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water to form carbonic acid it dissociates to bicarbonate and a proton.

:::{note}
:class: dropdown
This is a good approximation in most cases, but be aware that the reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with water is much slower than the dissociation reactions because it involves breaking strong C-O bonds, whereas the dissociation simply adds and removes protons (H<sup>+</sup>).
This means that the CO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> appriximation will start to break down in dynamic systems where DIC speciation is far from equilibrium with CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>.
This can become important when considering rapid ocean-atmosphere interactions, because CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>, rather than than H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is the species that exchanges with CO<sub>2(g)</sub> in the atmosphere.
::: 

From the dissociation reaction above, you can see that the abundance of each DIC species will vary as a function of pH (where $pH = -log_{10}[H^+]$).

<!-- - Reacts with water to form a weak **diprotic** acid, carbonic acid, which dissociates.
  - $\mathrm{CO_{2(aq)} + H_2O \leftrightarrow H_2CO_3 \leftrightarrow HCO_3^- + H^+ \leftrightarrow HCO_3^{2-} + 2H^+}$
- {term}`DIC` is the sum of the dissolved, C-containing species:
  - $\mathrm{DIC = [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}]}$
  - Square brackets denote concentration.
  - Units generally $\mathrm{\mu mol~kg^{-1}}$ - 'average' seawater has around $\mathrm{2100 \mu mol~kg^{-1}}$
- The abundance of each species is linked to the pH of seawater ($\mathrm{pH = -\log_{10}[H^+]}$)

## $\mathrm{CO_2}$ and pH

The speciation of DIC is described by the **stoichiometric equilibrium constants** K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>:

::::{margin}
:::{note}
The speciation of DIC has five unknowns (pCO<sub>2</sub>, pH, [CO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>], [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] and [CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]), and is described by the four equations for DIC and the speciation constants K<sub>0</sub>, K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>. This means that you need to know two of the unknowns to fully characterise DIC speciation.
:::
::::

```{math}
:label: eq:co2sw:Ks
K_1 &= \frac{[H^+][HCO_3^-]}{[CO_2^*]} \\
K_2 &= \frac{[H^+][CO_3^{2-}]}{[HCO_3^-]}
```

which can be combined with the definition of DIC above to calculate the abundance of each DIC species as a function of [DIC], [H<sup>+</sup>] and the equilibrium constants K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>:

\begin{align}
DIC &= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}] \\
&= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + \frac{K_2 [HCO_3^-]}{[H^+]} & substitute ~ [CO_3^{2-}] ~ using ~ K_2 \\
&= [CO_2^*] + \frac{K_1[CO_2^*]}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_2 K_1 [CO_2^*]}{[H^+]^2} & substitute ~ [HCO_3^{-}] ~ using ~ K_1 \\
&= [CO_2^*] \left( 1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_2 K_1}{[H^+]^2} \right) & separate ~ [CO_2^*] \\
[CO_2^*] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2}} & solve ~ for ~ [CO_2^*]
\end{align}
$
```

```{math}
:label: eq:co2sw:speciation
[CO_2^*] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2}} \\
[HCO_3^-] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{[H^+]}{K_1} + \frac{K_2}{[H^+]^2}} \\
[CO_3^{2-}] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{[H^+]}{K_2} + \frac{[H^+]^2}{K_1K_2}} \\
```

At standard salinity and temperature (35, 25 C) and 1 atmosphere pressure (surface seawater), these Ks and $pKs$ ($-log_{10}K$) are:

|       | $K$ | $pK$ |
|:------|-------|-------------|
| $K_0$ | $2.839 \times 10^{-2}$ | 1.547 |
| $K_1$ | $1.422 \times 10^{-6}$ | 5.847 |
| $K_2$ | $1.082 \times 10^{-9}$ | 8.966 |

## Conservative Tracer for Speciation

A final important concept in carbon speciation is the concept of **Total Alkalinity (TA)**.
This somewhat-tricky concept is a key property for describing ocean carbon because it is *conservative* (does not change with temperature or pressure, like mass, salt or DIC).
This is important because the concentration of the dissolved carbon species and pH all vary substantially with temperature and pressure.
This makes it difficult to understand whether the carbon system is being modified by external processes, or simply responding to changes in physical conditions.
A change in DIC or TA has to be caused by an external process acting on the water body.
Along with DIC, this provides two conservative quantities that can be used to fully describe the concentration and speciation of carbon in seawater.

So now we know why we might want it, what is it?!
Total Alkalinity can be described in different ways depending on the context.
For example, TA is:
1. the charge difference between conservative anions and cations
2. the excess of proton acceptors over donors
3. the moles of acid per kg of seawater that must be added to reach the 'equivalence point', where $[H^+] = [HCO_3^-]$

For our purposes you can think of TA as 'setting' both the pH and DIC speciation in seawater such that the positive and negative charges in that water balance.
For a more complete undertanding of the topic, I recommend Section 1.2 of {cite}`Zeebe2001`.

Regardless of the precise definition you use to get there, the important species that make up TA in seawater are:

$$
TA = [HCO_3^-] + 2 [CO_3^{2-}] + [B(OH)_4^-] + [OH^-] - [H^+]
$$


<!-- {term}`Total Alkalinity`
- Describes the charge balance of seawater.
- Conservative, as includes positive and negative species.
- Useful second parameter for tracking C speciation.
- No analytical solution, but...
  - Show carbonate alkalinity approximations.
  - Mention carbon calculators that do it for you. -->
