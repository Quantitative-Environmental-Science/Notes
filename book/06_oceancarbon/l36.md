The majority of carbon (~98%) in the ocean exists as {term}`Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)<DIC>`.
The DIC pool is therefore the primary carbon reservoir in the ocean, and the chemical properties of DIC determine the ocean's ability to store carbon.
We'll now look at how CO<sub>2</sub> is related to DIC.

## CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in water

<!-- - Ideal gasses dissolve into water following Henry's Law ($K_0$)
- Sensitive to temperature
  - Think: what happens as water changes temperature?
  - Refer back to CO2 patterns.
- Calculate DIC concentration from pCO2 with only $K_0$ -->


As we saw in the last lecture, CO<sub>2(g)</sub> behaves like an ideal gas and dissolves from air into water until it reaches an equilibrium with CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> concentration that is described by **Henry's Law** (Eq. {eq}`eq:carbon:henrys`):

The solubility of a gas in water depends strongly on temperature, and weakly on salinity ({numref}`fig:carbon:K0`).
More gas will dissolve into colder, fresher water than warmer, saltier water.

The variability of gas solubility interacts with Thermohaline Circulation (THC) to elevate carbon concentrations in the deep ocean.
During surface transport (e.g. along Western boundary currents like the Gulf Stream) water loses heat to the atmosphere and cools down ({numref}`fig:carbon:oceanheat`).
This increases $K_0$, allowing the water to hold more dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> at a given atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub>.
The water reaches as a temperature minimum, and therefore [CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>] maximum, at its density maximum just before it sinks to the deep ocean.
Once in the deep ocean that water is isolated from the atmosphere until it resurfaces somewhere along the circulation path.
The downwelling of cold, CO<sub>2</sub>-rich water therefore removes carbon from the atmosphere until that water is upwelled again 100s-1000s of years later.
Consequently, these upwelling zones outgas CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere as the water warms up at the surface.
This cycle, driven by changes in gas solubility in water, is known as the **solubility pump**.

```

The solubulity of CO<sub>2</sub> explains first-order patterns of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and release in terms of ocean circulation, but is not enough to explain the high concentration of inorganic carbon in the ocean.
If we take the entire range of $K_0$ (0.02 to 0.07) at modern atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> (420 ppm), this only allows an equilibrium CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> concentration of between 8.4-33.6 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup>.
Measurements of inorganic carbon in the ocean show that the actual concentration is on the order of ~2000 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup>.

## CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water

<!-- - Reacts with water to form a weak **diprotic** acid, carbonic acid, which dissociates.
  - $\mathrm{CO_{2(aq)} + H_2O \leftrightarrow H_2CO_3 \leftrightarrow HCO_3^- + H^+ \leftrightarrow HCO_3^{2-} + 2H^+}$
- {term}`DIC` is the sum of the dissolved, C-containing species:
  - $\mathrm{DIC = [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}]}$
  - Square brackets denote concentration.
  - Units generally $\mathrm{\mu mol~kg^{-1}}$ - 'average' seawater has around $\mathrm{2100 \mu mol~kg^{-1}}$
- The abundance of each species is linked to the pH of seawater ($\mathrm{pH = -\log_{10}[H^+]}$)

There is more carbon in the ocean than we would expect based on gas solubility because CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> reacts with water to form non-gaseous species that cannot exchange with the atmosphere.
Once CO<sub>2(g)</sub> is dissolved  to CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> it reacts with water to form a weak **diprotic** acid (an acid with two protons, H<sup>+</sup>) called carbonic acid.
This acid dissociates to produce the **Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)** species:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:dissociation
CO_{2(g)} \leftrightarrow \underbrace{CO_{2(aq)}}_{dissolved~gas} + H_2O \leftrightarrow \underbrace{H_2CO_3}_{carbonic~acid} \leftrightarrow \underbrace{HCO_3^-}_{bicarbonate} + H^+ \leftrightarrow \underbrace{CO_3^{2-}}_{carbonate} + 2H^+
```

Where DIC is defined as the sum of these species in seawater:

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
Square brackets denote the concentration of a dissolved chemical species
```

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:dic
DIC &= [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}] \\
&= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}]
```

where $[CO_2^*] = [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3]$ because carbonic acid is functionally absent in normal seawater - as soon as CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> reacts with water the carbonic acid dissociates to form bicarbonate and a proton.

```{admonition} Note on CO<sub>2</sub>*...
:class: dropdown
[CO<sub>2</sub><sup>\*</sup>] is a good approximation in most cases, but be aware that the reaction of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> with water is much slower than the subsequent dissociation reactions because it requires breaking strong C-O bonds, whereas the dissociation involves adding/removing weakly-bound protons (H<sup>+</sup>).
This means that the CO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> approximation may start to break down in dynamic systems where DIC speciation is far from equilibrium with CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>.
This can become important when considering rapid ocean-atmosphere interactions, because CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>, rather than than H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is the species that exchanges with CO<sub>2(g)</sub> in the atmosphere.
```

Because CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> is the only species that exchanges with CO<sub>2(g)</sub> in the atmosphere, the speciation of DIC is critical when considering the relationship between DIC and pCO<sub>2</sub>.
From Eq {eq}`eq:carbon:dissociation` we see that DIC speciation will depend on the concentration of each of the DIC species and **H<sup>+</sup>** in the water.
The concentration of H<sup>+</sup> is described by the pH of the water (pH = -log<sub>10</sub>[H<sup>+</sup>]), which tells us that the concentration of the carbon species in seawater is a function of pH ({numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum`).

```

Note that at normal surface seawater pH (~8.1, {numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum`), very little of the DIC is in the form of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> - most is in the form of the non-exchangeable species bicarbonate and carbonate.

### DIC Speciation

The speciation of DIC is described by acid-base equilibria described by the **equilibrium constants** K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:K_reactions
CO_{2}^* &\overset{K_1}{\leftrightarrow} HCO_3^- + H^+ \\
HCO_3^- &\overset{K_2}{\leftrightarrow} CO_3^{2-} + H^+
```

Where K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> are defined as:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:Ks
K_1 &= \frac{[H^+][HCO_3^-]}{[CO_2^*]} \\
K_2 &= \frac{[H^+][CO_3^{2-}]}{[HCO_3^-]}
```

These can be combined to define the concentration of each DIC species as a function of [DIC], pH and the equilibrium constants K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>:

```{admonition} [CO<sub>2</sub>*] derivation...
:class: dropdown

$$
\begin{align}
DIC &= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}] \\
&= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + \frac{K_2 [HCO_3^-]}{[H^+]} & \mathrm{substitute ~ [CO_3^{2-}] ~ using ~ K_2} \\
&= [CO_2^*] + \frac{K_1[CO_2^*]}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_2 K_1 [CO_2^*]}{[H^+]^2} & \mathrm{substitute ~ [HCO_3^{-}] ~ using ~ K_1} \\
&= [CO_2^*] \left( 1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_2 K_1}{[H^+]^2} \right) & \mathrm{separate ~ [CO_2^*]} \\
[CO_2^*] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2}} & \mathrm{solve ~ for ~ [CO_2^*]}
\end{align}
$$
```

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:speciation
[CO_2^*] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2}} \\
[HCO_3^-] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{[H^+]}{K_1} + \frac{K_2}{[H^+]^2}} \\
[CO_3^{2-}] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{[H^+]}{K_2} + \frac{[H^+]^2}{K_1K_2}} \\
```

These Ks have been carefully determined for seawater, and can be calculated as a function of temperature, salinity and pressure.
At standard salinity and temperature (35, 25 °C) and 1 atmosphere pressure (surface seawater), these K and pK (-log<sub>10</sub>K) are:

|       | $K$   | $pK$        |
|:------|-------|-------------|
| $K_0$ | $2.839 \times 10^{-2}$ | 1.547 |
| $K_1$ | $1.422 \times 10^{-6}$ | 5.847 |
| $K_2$ | $1.082 \times 10^{-9}$ | 8.966 |

Where the pK values denote the pH at which the species are present in equal concentrations ({numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum`).

Because these Ks are sensitive temperature, salinty and pressure, the speciation of DIC also shifts as the properties of the water change.

```{admonition} Solving the DIC system...
:class: dropdown

We've now seen that measuring the concentration of DIC in seawater is not enough to understand ocean carbon - we also need to know the state of the carbon species in seawater. How do we determine this?

The equilibrium equations in {eq}`eq:carbon:Ks` define a system of two equations with four unknowns ($[CO_2^*], [HCO_3^-], [CO_3^{2-}] and [H^+]$). To determine the concentration of an individual DIC species we therefore need to know two of these variables.

In reality only one of these variables, pH, can be practically measured in seawater, which presents a problem.
There are, however, two other properties that can be readily measured related to ocean carbon: DIC contencentration, and Total Alkalinity $(TA = 2 [CO_3^{2-}] + [HCO_3^-] + [minor~bases] + [OH^-] - [H^+])$, which is the sum of the charge of weak bases in seawater (don't worry about this - it's far beyond the scope of this course!).
We now have four equations and six unknowns, but three of those unknowns are relatively easy to measure in seawater.
```

### Equilibrium: pCO<sub>2</sub>, pH and DIC

From the equations and K values above, we can calculate that for a typical ocean pH of ~8.1, only ~0.5% of DIC exists as CO<sub>2</sub>* at 'standard' conditions.
This shows why the concentration of DIC in the ocean is so much higher than predicted by the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.
However, this simple calculation implies that pH and DIC speciation are independent of each other, which is not the case.

In {numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum` we show the concentration of the DIC species changing solely as a function of water pH, but this is only true for a fixed DIC concentration.
You can see from {eq}`eq:carbon:K_reactions`-{eq}`eq:carbon:speciation` that the concentration of each DIC species and [H<sup>+</sup>] (and therefore pH) exist in an *equilibrium*.
This means that if any component of the system is changed, all parts of the system will adjust to reach a new equilibrium state.

This has two important consequences for our understanding of ocean carbon:
#### 1. pCO<sub>2</sub> and pH

Atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> and ocean pH are coupled - increasing pCO<sub>2</sub> will decrease pH in a process known as **Ocean Acidification**.
This follows directly from {eq}`eq:carbon:dic`, where we see that the immediate dissociation of carbonic acid releases a proton into the ocean.
The majority of these protons will react with CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> to form HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, but the new equilibrium reached will be at a lower pH, with consequently different DIC speciation (towards the left in {numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum`).

Vertical lines show representative pre-industrial and modern pCO<sub>2</sub> values, highlighting the drop in surface ocean pH that has already occurred in the last ~200 years. Note that because pH is a log scale, a 0.1 unit decrease corresponds to a ~doubling of [H<sup>+</sup>].
```

Conversely, any process that independently alters the pH of the ocean will change the speciation of DIC, allowing the surface ocean to take up or release CO<sub>2</sub>. This becomes important when considering biological processes, which we will discuss in the next two sections.

#### 2. pCO<sub>2</sub> and DIC

DIC does not increase with [CO<sub>2</sub>*] in a 1:1 relationship.
{numref}`fig:carbon:pCO2-DIC` shows the change in DIC concentration and speciation as pCO<sub>2</sub> increases.
Here, the increase in [CO<sub>2</sub>*] is set entirely by Henry's Law, but the total increase in DIC concentration includes the increase in non-exchangeable carbon species that occurs as that CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water in the ocean.
This causes the total increase in DIC per unit pCO2 to be much greater than the increase in [CO<sub>2</sub>*] alone, amplifying the effect of solubility pump that is driven by changes in CO<sub>2</sub> solubility.

Change in DIC concentration and speciation in warm and cold water as pCO<sub>2</sub> increases. Note that the increase in DIC concentration is much greater than the change in [CO<sub>2</sub>*]. This is because the a large part of the increase in DIC is due to the increase in non-exchangeable DIC species. Note that pH will also be decreasing over this range, as seen in {numref}`fig:carbon:pCO2-pH`.

## Modelling the Solubility Pump

To include the solubility pump in our model, we must include two new tracers and one new process in our model:

- The concentration of DIC
- The speciation of DIC
- The exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> between the atmosphere and the surface ocean

### DIC Tracer

### Speciation Tracer

### Ocean-Atmosphere Exchange

<!-- ## Conservative Tracer for Speciation

A final important concept in carbon speciation is the concept of **Total Alkalinity (TA)**.
This somewhat-tricky concept is a key property for describing ocean carbon because it is *conservative* (does not change with temperature or pressure, like mass, salt or DIC).
This is important because the concentration of the dissolved carbon species and pH all vary substantially with temperature and pressure.
This makes it difficult to understand whether the carbon system is being modified by external processes, or simply responding to changes in physical conditions.
A change in DIC or TA has to be caused by an external process acting on the water body.
Along with DIC, this provides two conservative quantities that can be used to fully describe the concentration and speciation of carbon in seawater.

So now we know why we might want it, what is it?!
Total Alkalinity can be described in different ways depending on the context.
For example, TA is:
1. the charge difference between conservative anions and cations
2. the excess of proton acceptors over donors
3. the moles of acid per kg of seawater that must be added to reach the 'equivalence point', where $[H^+] = [HCO_3^-]$

For our purposes you can think of TA as 'setting' both the pH and DIC speciation in seawater such that the positive and negative charges in that water balance.
For a more complete undertanding of the topic, I recommend Section 1.2 of {cite}`Zeebe2001`.

Regardless of the precise definition you use to get there, the important species that make up TA in seawater are:

$$
TA = [HCO_3^-] + 2 [CO_3^{2-}] + [B(OH)_4^-] + [OH^-] - [H^+]
$$ -->


<!-- {term}`Total Alkalinity`
- Describes the charge balance of seawater.
- Conservative, as includes positive and negative species.
- Useful second parameter for tracking C speciation.

  - Show carbonate alkalinity approximations.
