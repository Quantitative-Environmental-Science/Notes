The majority of carbon (~98%) in the ocean exists as {term}`Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)<DIC>`.
We'll now look at how CO<sub>2</sub> is related to DIC, and how the chemical properties of DIC affect the ocean's ability to store carbon.

## CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in water

<!-- - Ideal gasses dissolve into water following Henry's Law ($K_0$)
- Sensitive to temperature
  - Think: what happens as water changes temperature?
  - Refer back to CO2 patterns.
- Calculate DIC concentration from pCO2 with only $K_0$ -->


As we saw in the last lecture, CO<sub>2(g)</sub> behaves like an ideal gas and dissolves from air into water until it reaches an equilibrium with CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> concentration that is described by **Henry's Law** (Eq. {eq}`eq:carbon:henrys`):

The solubility of a gas in water depends strongly on temperature, and weakly on salinity {numref}`fig:carbon:K0`.
More gas will dissolve into colder, fresher water than warmer, saltier water.

This property of gas solubility interacts with Thermohaline Circulation (THC) to elevate carbon concentrations in the deep ocean.
During surface transport (e.g. along Western boundary currents like the Gulf Stream) water loses heat to the atmosphere and cools down.
This increases $K_0$, allowing the water to hold more dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> at a given atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub>.
The water reaches as a temperature minimum, and therefore [CO<sub>2</sub>] maximum, just before it sinks to the deep ocean where it is isolated from the atmosphere.
The downwelling of cold, CO<sub>2</sub>-rich water removes this carbon from the atmosphere until that water is upwelled again 100s-1000s of years later.
Consequently, these upwelling zones outgas CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere as the water warms up at the surface.
This cycle, driven by changes in gas solubility in water, is known as the **solubility pump**.

However, the solubulity of CO<sub>2</sub> alone is not enough to explain the high concentration of DIC in the ocean.
If we take the entire range of $K_0$ (0.02 to 0.07) at modern atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> (420 ppm), this predicts a total CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> concentration of 8.4-33.6 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup>.
Measurements of DIC in the ocean show that the actual concentration is more on the order of 2000 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup>.

## CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water

DIC is higher in the ocean that we would expect based on gas solubility because CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> reacts with water to form non-gaseous species.
Once CO<sub>2(g)</sub> is dissolved  to CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> it reacts with water to form a weak **diprotic** acid (an acid with two protons, H<sup>+</sup>) called carbonic acid.
This acid dissociates to produce the dissolved species:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:dissociation
CO_{2(g)} \leftrightarrow \underbrace{CO_{2(aq)}}_{dissolved~gas} + H_2O \leftrightarrow \underbrace{H_2CO_3}_{carbonic~acid} \leftrightarrow \underbrace{HCO_3^-}_{bicarbonate} + H^+ \leftrightarrow \underbrace{CO_3^{2-}}_{carbonate} + 2H^+
```

DIC contains all the dissolved inorganic carbon chemicals in seawater, and is defined as:

```{margin} Units!
:class: units

```

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:dic
DIC &= [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}] \\
&= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}]
```

where $[CO_2^*] = [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3]$ because carbonic acid is functionally absent in normal seawater - as soon as CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> reacts with water the carbonic acid dissociates to form bicarbonate and a proton.

```{admonition} Note on CO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>
:class: dropdown
[CO<sub>2</sub><sup>\*</sup>] is a good approximation in most cases, but be aware that the reaction of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> with water is much slower than the subsequent dissociation reactions because it requires breaking strong C-O bonds, whereas the dissociation involves adding/removing weakly-bound protons (H<sup>+</sup>).
This means that the CO<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> approximation may start to break down in dynamic systems where DIC speciation is far from equilibrium with CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>.
This can become important when considering rapid ocean-atmosphere interactions, because CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>, rather than than H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is the species that exchanges with CO<sub>2(g)</sub> in the atmosphere.
```

Because CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> is the only species that exchanges with CO<sub>2(g)</sub> in the atmosphere, the speciation of DIC is critical when considering the relationship between DIC and pCO<sub>2</sub>.
From Eq {eq}`eq:carbon:dissociation` we see that DIC speciation will depend on the concentration of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>, carbonic acid, bicarbonate and bicarbonate, and the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in the water.
The concentration of H<sup>+</sup> is described by the pH of the water (pH = -log<sub>10</sub>[H<sup>+</sup>]), which provides a direct link between seawater pH, DIC speciation and pCO<sub>2</sub> ({numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum`).

## DIC Speciation

The speciation of DIC is described by acid-base equilibria described by the **equilibrium constants** K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:K_reactions
CO_{2(aq)}^* &\overset{K_1}{\leftrightarrow} HCO_3^- + H^+ \\
HCO_3^- &\overset{K_2}{\leftrightarrow} CO_3^{2-} + H^+
```

Where K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> are defined as:

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:Ks
K_1 &= \frac{[H^+][HCO_3^-]}{[CO_2^*]} \\
K_2 &= \frac{[H^+][CO_3^{2-}]}{[HCO_3^-]}
```

These can be combined to define the concentration of each DIC species as a function of [DIC], pH and the equilibrium constants K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>:

```{admonition} Click to show $[CO_2^*]$ derivation...
:class: dropdown

$$
\begin{align}
DIC &= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}] \\
&= [CO_2^*] + [HCO_3^-] + \frac{K_2 [HCO_3^-]}{[H^+]} & \mathrm{substitute ~ [CO_3^{2-}] ~ using ~ K_2} \\
&= [CO_2^*] + \frac{K_1[CO_2^*]}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_2 K_1 [CO_2^*]}{[H^+]^2} & \mathrm{substitute ~ [HCO_3^{-}] ~ using ~ K_1} \\
&= [CO_2^*] \left( 1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_2 K_1}{[H^+]^2} \right) & \mathrm{separate ~ [CO_2^*]} \\
[CO_2^*] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2}} & \mathrm{solve ~ for ~ [CO_2^*]}
\end{align}
$$
```

```{math}
:label: eq:carbon:speciation
[CO_2^*] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2}} \\
[HCO_3^-] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{[H^+]}{K_1} + \frac{K_2}{[H^+]^2}} \\
[CO_3^{2-}] &= \frac{DIC}{1 + \frac{[H^+]}{K_2} + \frac{[H^+]^2}{K_1K_2}} \\
```

At standard salinity and temperature (35, 25 C) and 1 atmosphere pressure (surface seawater), these Ks and $pKs$ ($-log_{10}K$) are:

|       | $K$   | $pK$        |
|:------|-------|-------------|
| $K_0$ | $2.839 \times 10^{-2}$ | 1.547 |
| $K_1$ | $1.422 \times 10^{-6}$ | 5.847 |
| $K_2$ | $1.082 \times 10^{-9}$ | 8.966 |

Where the pK values denote the pH at which the species are present in equal concentrations ({numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum`).

## Speciation and Circulation 

The $K$ values describing the speciation of DIC are sensitive to temperature and salinity.
This means that as well as CO<sub>2</sub> becoming more soluble in the cooling water along the surface circulation path, the speciation of DIC also shifts ({numref}`fig:carbon:bjerrum_temp`).

## Conservative Tracer for Speciation

A final important concept in carbon speciation is the concept of **Total Alkalinity (TA)**.
This somewhat-tricky concept is a key property for describing ocean carbon because it is *conservative* (does not change with temperature or pressure, like mass, salt or DIC).
This is important because the concentration of the dissolved carbon species and pH all vary substantially with temperature and pressure.
This makes it difficult to understand whether the carbon system is being modified by external processes, or simply responding to changes in physical conditions.
A change in DIC or TA has to be caused by an external process acting on the water body.
Along with DIC, this provides two conservative quantities that can be used to fully describe the concentration and speciation of carbon in seawater.

So now we know why we might want it, what is it?!
Total Alkalinity can be described in different ways depending on the context.
For example, TA is:
1. the charge difference between conservative anions and cations
2. the excess of proton acceptors over donors
3. the moles of acid per kg of seawater that must be added to reach the 'equivalence point', where $[H^+] = [HCO_3^-]$

For our purposes you can think of TA as 'setting' both the pH and DIC speciation in seawater such that the positive and negative charges in that water balance.
For a more complete undertanding of the topic, I recommend Section 1.2 of {cite}`Zeebe2001`.

Regardless of the precise definition you use to get there, the important species that make up TA in seawater are:

$$
TA = [HCO_3^-] + 2 [CO_3^{2-}] + [B(OH)_4^-] + [OH^-] - [H^+]
$$


<!-- {term}`Total Alkalinity`
