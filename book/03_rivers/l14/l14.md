# Surface flow into a river

In a catchment there are a series of drainage zones, each flowing into a stream and then into the river, in a hierarchical way.
This leads to the question of how to build a model for the whole drainage basin which is more complex that the idealised bucket model.
We also may use such a detailed model to assess the value of l in the model based on the more detailed physical processes in a more complete model.
To this end we consider the next step of development of the model which is to consider the drainage along the land from the watershed to a stream as shown in {numref}`surface_drainage`.

The speed of the flow down the slope may be given in terms of the permeable flow relation (Darcy law) for flow through crops, wooded land or other surfaces with considerable resistance.

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
u &= \mathrm{m~s^{-1}} \\
\rho &= \mathrm{kg~m^{-3}} \\
g &= \mathrm{m~s^{-2}} \\
\theta &= \mathrm{radians} \\
\mu &= \mathrm{kg~m^{-1}~s^{-1}} \\
k &= \mathrm{m^2} \\
$$
```

```{math}
u = \rho g \sin{(\theta)} \frac{k}{\mu}
```

And the outflow $Q$ is given by $u S$, where $S$ is evaluated at the base of the surface flow zone, at the stream.

To relate this to the flow along the slope, we require a model of the change of the surface storage along the slope as the rain falls.
If we denote the surface storage as $S(x,t)$ then the change of surface storage in a length of slope $\mathrm{d}x$ over a time $\mathrm{d}t$ is given by the build up of rain $R~\mathrm{d}x~\mathrm{d}t$ minus the infiltration over this time, $I~\mathrm{d}x~\mathrm{d}t$, as well as the difference of the flow into the element, $u S(x,t)~\mathrm{d}t$ and the flow out of the element $u S~(x+\mathrm{d}x,t)~\mathrm{d}t$.

This leads to the balance:

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
Q &= \mathrm{m^3~s^{-1}} \\
R, I &= \mathrm{m~s^{-1}} \\
S &= \mathrm{m^2} \\
L &= \mathrm{m} \\
$$
```

```{math}
S(x, t + \delta t) \delta x - S(x, t) \delta x = R \delta x \delta t - I \delta x \delta t + u S(x, t) \delta t - u S(x + \delta x, t) \delta t
```

And hence the equation:

```{math}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = R - I - u \frac{\partial S}{\partial x}
```

Governing the change of surface storage along the surface from the watershed to the stream (in the direction of the flow along the surface).

We need to find the value of $S(L,t)$ at the point where the surface flow drains into the stream. To do this we seek a solution of the form:

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
W &= \mathrm{m^2} \\
\eta &= \mathrm{m} \\
\tau &= \mathrm{s} \\
$$
```

```{math}
S(x,t) = W(\eta, \tau)
```

Where $\eta = x - u t$ and $\tau = t$.

This leads to the relations:

```{math}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} &= - u \frac{\partial W}{\partial \eta} + \frac{\partial W}{\partial \tau} \\
\frac{\partial W}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial W}{\partial \eta}
\end{align}
```

And the equation becomes:

```{math}
\frac{\partial W}{\partial \tau} = R - I
```

If we solve this equation on lines $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$, then we find that

```{math}
W(\eta, \tau) = W(\eta, 0) + (R - I) \tau
```

We want the solution when $x = L$ (i.e. the value of $S$ at the stream). The lines of $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$ are shown on the $x-t$ plane in {numref}`eta_constant`.

Lines of $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$ on the $x-t$ plane
```

There are two regions â€“ the set of points where $x = L$ and $t \lt L/u$, for which lines $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$ start on the x-axis at time = 0 (e.g. the line starting at $x_0$), and for each of these lines, the time at which they reach the distance $x = L$ is $(L-x_0)/u$. This is the time for the line of constant $\eta$ starting at $x=x_0$ at $t=0$ to reach the line $x = L$, and so the value of $W$ (and hence $S$) at time $t$ and at $x = L$ is $w=(R-I)t$.

The other region corresponds to the points $x=L$ and $t \gt L/u$. In this region the lines of constant $\eta$ which reach $x = L$ for $t \gt L/u$ start at $x = 0$ at a time $t0 \gt 0$.
Hence, the time to reach the line $x = L$ is $L/u$, and so at $x = L$, $w = (R-I) L/u$ if $t \gt L/u$.

As a result, the flux at $x = L$ is given by

```{math}
\begin{align}
u S &= u (R - I) t && t \lt L / u\\
&= (R - I) L && t \geq L / u
\end{align}
```

Matching this latter solution for equilibrium, with the equilibrium solution for the bucket model, we find that the parameter $\lambda$ in the bucket model is given by

```{math}
\lambda = u / L
```

and this is the time constant for reaching equilibrium between the surface water accumulation and flow into the streams.
