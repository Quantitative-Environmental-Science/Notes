# River flows

The previous section focussed on flow in the catchment towards a river. Some very simplified models for the surface run-off in terms of the rainfall flux were developed to help inform relationships between the rainfall rate and the rate at which this flows into a river.

To interpret these models of the surface runoff, we need a model for the flow in a river to understand if the river can accommodate the flow, or if it will overtop its banks and flood. As a simple model, a river has a cross-section area $A(h)$ as a function of the water depth, and the water in the river moves downstream with speed u. 
If the river inclination is $\theta$ then the gravity force down slope is

```{math}
F_g = g \sin{(\theta)} \rho A
```

and the drag force resisting this flow is

```{math}
F_d = C_D \rho u^2 P
```

where $P(h)$ is the wetted perimeter of the river bed and $C_D$ is the drag coefficient of the river bed.

If we balance these flows we find that the speed

```{math}
u(h) = \sqrt{\frac{A(h)}{P(h)} \frac{g}{C_D}\sin{(\theta)}}
```

And the volume flow in the river is approximately

```{math}
Q = A(h) u(h)
```

In a specific example, we might consider that the river area $A(h) = \alpha h^2$ and that the perimeter $P(h) = \beta h$ so that

```{math}
Q(h) = (\alpha^3 / \beta)^{1/2)} (g \sin{(\theta)} / C_D)^{1/2} h^{5/2}
```

Is the law for the flux in the river.

```

This provides a reasonable simplified model for the flow in many rivers, for example the chart above compares this formula with data from the River Severn showing flow as a function of the water depth.

An initial result emerging from this model is that if the level of the banks are at $z = h^*$ above the base of the river, then the critical flow rate of water in the river above which it begins to flood is

```{math}
Q^* = Q(h^*)
```

If we want to use this model for the river flow to reduce the flood we see that the key controls we have are (a) raising the height of the banks; (b) deepening the river; (c) widening the river.

```

Our earlier idealised models for the surface runoff identify how more intense and longer duration rain events lead to a greater flux reaching the river,
and hence we can explore the type of rainstorm which will lead to the flux exceeding the maximum river flux in terms of the model for the runoff.
Given statistics for the distribution of expected rainfall intensity and rainfall duration, 
it is then possible to design mitigation measures to reduce the flux arriving at the river from the run-off for a given rainstorm.
There is then a cost benefit analysis to be carried out to determine the benefit of mitigating the flood risk for different intensity storms:
this involves estimating the costs of the mitigation measures compared to the costs of the damage produced by the flooding multiplied by the risk of the flooding.

## Coupled Model

If we combine the runoff model with the river model we find the following comparison plot, illustrating how different types of rainfall lead to different flow regimes (ie flooding or not)

This model, although simplified, has features in common with the classical river hydrograph ({numref}`hydrograph`) in which we plot the rainfall flux and the river flow rate as a function of time.
