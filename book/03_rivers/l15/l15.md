# River Flooding

In order to arrest the flow of water from the surface run-off into the
river and help mitigate a flood, sometimes reservoirs are built
upstream. These lead to accumulation of the surface run-off in the
upstream section of the river, and limit the magnitude of the flow which
reaches regions further downstream.

In order to model the effect of a reservoir, we consider a reservoir of
area $A(h)$ when it is filled to height $h$. We assume the upstream waters
flow into the reservoir, and the water moving downstream from the
reservoir exits the reservoir from an opening at the base of the
reservoir wall of area $A_o$. The speed of this outflow will be
$(2gh)^\frac{1}{2}$ when the water in the reservoir has depth $h$, and so the flux
leaving the reservoir is $A_o(2gh)^\frac{1}{2}$.

As water flows into the reservoir, the volume deepens according to the
mixmatch between the inflow and the outflow

:::{math}
A(h) \dv{h}{t} = Q_{upstream} - Q_{outflow}
:::

There is an equilibrium solution for this system where the inflow and
outflow to the reservoir match, and this occurs when the depth of the
reservoir is

:::{math}
h_e = \frac{Q_o^2}{A_o^2 g}
:::

We can then find time dependent solutions.

Let us choose the area of the reservoir to vary as

:::{math}
A(h) = \alpha h^2
:::

And for convenience we will introduce a dimensionless reservoir depth $y$
and time $\tau$ given by

:::{math}
h = h_e y \quad \tau = \frac{Q_o}{\alpha h_e^3} t
:::

It then follows that

:::{math}
\mu^2 \dv{\mu}{\tau} = 1-y^\frac{1}{2}
:::

This equation can be solved but the algebra becomes involved (use the
substitution $y = (1-s) ^2$ ), so we can instead solve the equation numerically, and
you obtain a solution of the form below.

Since $y$ takes some time to reach equilibrium, the outflow to the river
of the full flow from the rain is reduced (until the reservoir fills
up).

We can combine this model for a reservoir with the earlier model for the
surface run-off to illustrate the effect of the reservoir in buffering
the surface run off. An example of this is shown in the figure below. We
combine the model of a rainstorm which leads to an increasing run-off
until the rain stops, and then a decaying run-off, as some
surface water drains into the ground and the remainder flows into the
reservoir.
