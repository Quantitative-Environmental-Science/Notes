# Course Overview

The course will begin with an overview of how the surface of the planet functions, with introductory lectures on the global carbon cycle, and the source of energy on the planet.
Then the course will comprise modules on groundwater pollution, ice melting, rivers and flooding, air pollution, and the physics and chemistry of the oceans and land and specifically the movement of carbon through Earthâ€™s surface environment.

In each module, students will learn about environmental challenges particular to that fluid and that environment, for example groundwater contamination, air pollution, floods and droughts.
Within each model, students will learn how to apply fundamental mathematics, which will be taught incidentally within each topic, towards the various environmental systems, in order to understand the changing planet and the future challenges we face under population growth and anthropogenic climate change.
Each module will contain case studies related to environmental challenges and solutions.
In the Easter term, the impact of the Energy Transition on the Environment will be explored, including how energy can be used efficiently and effectively (wind, solar, engineered buildings) and some of the environmental challenges associated with the energy transition (capture of carbon, storage of carbon underground, geoengineering).
The course will consist of 57 lectures, three lectures per week.
There will be problem/example sheets provided for support during weekly supervisions (20 weeks of supervision).

## How to use this Website

This website contains summary notes to accompany each lecture of the course.
These are divided into thematic blocks, corresponding to the eight lecture blocks of the course.

These notes are intended to complement the lectures; they will not contain all the material you are given in lectures and are not intended as a replacement for the lectures.
It is essential to attend the course lectures and complete the practical components of the course if you want to do well.
