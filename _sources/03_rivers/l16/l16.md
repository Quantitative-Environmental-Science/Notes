# Flood Waves

We now turn our attention to the propagation of flood waves down a river.
This is important to predict since it is useful to know the time of arrival of a flood many tens of km downstream in order to provide warning to residents and try to mitigate the impacts,
but also for planning flood prevention systems for example.

The famous flood from the Geitro glacier formed a flood wave which moved down a valley as shown in the figure below.

The flood wave can be found in a case where the flow is frictionally controlled that

:::{math}
Q(h) = k h^\frac{5}{2}
:::

and the area of the river scales as

:::{math}
A(h) = a h^2
:::

Now if the flow down the river changes, the depth at a given point may change.
Indeed, if more flow enters than leaves a control volume, then the evolution  of the depth follows the law

:::{math}
\dv{A}{h} \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}
:::

Substitute for $A$ and $Q$ to find the equation in terms of $h$

:::{math}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{5k}{2 \alpha} h^\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = 0
:::
<!-- TODO: Should this be \frac{5k}{4 \alpha} throughout? -->

There is a solution dependent on constant depth flow moving down the channel with speed that depends on depth.
On the flood wave

:::{math}
x = \frac{5k}{2 \alpha} h^\frac{1}{2} t
:::

so, rearranging for $h$

:::{math}
h = \left( \frac{5k}{2 \alpha} \frac{x}{t} \right)^2
:::

Using this solution for the long time depth of the current, we can estimate the nose location and depth.

We first work out the volume in the flow and this leads to an expression for the position of the nose

:::{math}
v = \int_0^{x_N} A(h) \dd{x}
:::

:::{math}
x_N(t) = \left[ \frac{5v}{\alpha} \left( \frac{5kt}{2 \alpha} \right)^4 \right] ^\frac{1}{5}
:::

Using this nose position we can establish the depth of the flow

:::{math}
h_N = \left( \frac{2 \alpha}{5k} \right)^\frac{1}{10} \left( \frac{5v}{\alpha} \right)^\frac{2}{5} t^{-\frac{2}{5}}
