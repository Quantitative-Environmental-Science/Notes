# Floods

In a catchment there are a series of drainage zones, each flowing into a stream and then into the river, in a hierarchical way.
This leads to the question of how to build a model for the whole drainage basin which is more complex that the idealised bucket model.
We also may used such a detailed model to assess the value of l in the model based on the more detailed physical processes in a more complete model.
To this end we consider the next step of development of the model which is to consider the drainage along the land from the watershed to a stream as shown in {numref}`surface_drainage`.

The speed of the flow down the slope may be given in terms of the permeable flow relation (Darcy law) for flow through crops, wooded land or other surfaces with considerable resistance.

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
u &= \mathrm{m~s^{-1}} \\
\rho &= \mathrm{kg~m^{-3}} \\
g &= \mathrm{m~s^{-2}} \\
\theta &= \mathrm{radians} \\
\mu &= \mathrm{kg~m^{-1}~s^{-1}} \\
k &= \mathrm{m^2} \\
$$
```

```{math}
u = \rho g \sin{(\theta)} \frac{k}{\mu}
```

And the outflow $Q$ is given by $u S$, where $S$ is evaluated at the base of the surface flow zone, at the stream.

To relate this to the flow along the slope, we require a model of the change of the surface storage along the slope as the rain falls.
If we denote the surface storage as $S(x,t)$ then the change of surface storage in a length of slope $\mathrm{d}x$ over a time $\mathrm{d}t$ is given by the build up of rain $R~\mathrm{d}x~\mathrm{d}t$ minus the infiltration over this time, $I~\mathrm{d}x~\mathrm{d}t$, as well as the difference of the flow into the element, $u S(x,t)~\mathrm{d}t$ and the flow out of the element $u S~(x+\mathrm{d}x,t)~\mathrm{d}t$.

This leads to the balance:

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
Q &= \mathrm{m^3~s^{-1}} \\
R, I &= \mathrm{m~s^{-1}} \\
S &= \mathrm{m^2} \\
L &= \mathrm{m} \\
$$
```

```{math}
S(x, t + \delta t) \delta x - S(x, t) \delta x = R \delta x \delta t - I \delta x \delta t + u S(x, t) \delta t - u S(x + \delta x, t) \delta t
```

And hence the equation:

```{math}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = R - I - u \frac{\partial S}{\partial x}
```

Governing the change of surface storage along the surface from the watershed to the stream (in the direction of the flow along the surface).

We need to find the value of $S(L,t)$ at the point where the surface flow drains into the stream. To do this we seek a solution of the form:

```{margin} Units!
:class: units
$$
W &= \mathrm{m^2} \\
\eta &= \mathrm{m} \\
\tau &= \mathrm{s} \\
$$
```

```{math}
S(x,t) = W(\eta, \tau)
```

Where $\eta = x - u t$ and $\tau = t$.

This leads to the relations:

```{math}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} &= - u \frac{\partial W}{\partial \eta} + \frac{\partial W}{\partial \tau} \\
\frac{\partial W}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial W}{\partial \eta}
\end{align}
```

And the equation becomes:

```{math}
\frac{\partial W}{\partial \tau} = R - I
```

If we solve this equation on lines $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$, then we find that

```{math}
W(\eta, \tau) = W(\eta, 0) + (R - I) \tau
```

We want the solution when $x = L$ (i.e. the value of $S$ at the stream). The lines of $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$ are shown on the $x-t$ plane in {numref}`eta_constant`.

Lines of $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$ on the $x-t$ plane
```

There are two regions â€“ the set of points where $x = L$ and $t \lt L/u$, for which lines $\eta = \mathrm{constant}$ start on the x axis at time = 0 (eg the line starting at $x_0$), and for each of these lines, the time at which they reach the distance $x = L$ is $(L-x_0)/u$. This is the time for the line of constant $\eta$ starting at $x=x_0$ at $t=0$ to reach the line $x = L$, and so the value of $W$ (and hence $S$) at time $t$ and at $x = L$ is $w=(R-I)t$.

The other region corresponds to the points $x=L$ and $t \gt L/u$. In this region the lines of constant $\eta$ which reach $x = L$ for $t \gt L/u$ start at $x = 0$ at a time $t0 \gt 0$.
Hence the time to reach the line $x = L$ is $L/u$, and so at $x = L$, $w = (R-I) L/u$ if $t \gt L/u$.

As a result, the flux at $x = L$ is given by

```{math}
\begin{align}
u S &= u (R - I) t && t \lt L / u\\
&= (R - I) L && t \geq L / u
\end{align}
```

Matching this latter solution for equilibrium, with the equilibrium solution for the bucket model, we find that the parameter $\lambda$ in the bucket model is given by

```{math}
\lambda = u / L
```

and this is the time constant for reaching equilibrium between the surface water accumulation and flow into the streams.

## River Flows

The previous section focussed on flow in the catchment towards a river. Some very simplified models for the surface run off in terms of the rainfall flux were developed to help inform relationships between the rainfall rate and the rate at which this flows into a river.

To interpret these models of the surface runoff, we need a model for the flow in a river to understand if the river can accommodate the flow, or if it will overtop its banks and flood. As a simple model, a river has a cross section area $A(h)$ as a function of the water depth, and the water in the river moves downstream with speed u.  If the river inclination is $\theta$ then the gravity force downslope is 

```{math}
F_g = g \sin{(\theta)} \rho A
```

and the drag force resisting this flow is

```{math}
F_d = C_D \rho u^2 P
```

where $P(h)$ is the wetted perimeter of the river bed and $C_D$ is the drag coefficient of the river bed.

figclass: margin-caption

```

If we balance these flows we find that the speed

```{math}
u(h) = \sqrt{\frac{A(h)}{P(h)} \frac{g}{C_D}\sin{(\theta)}}
```

And the volume flow in the river is approximately

```{math}
Q = A(h) u(h)
```

In a specific example, we might consider that the river area $A(h) = \alpha h^2$ and that the perimeter $P(h) = \beta h$ so that

```{math}
Q(h) = (\alpha^3 / \beta)^{1/2)} (g \sin{(\theta)} / C_D)^{1/2} h^{5/2}
```

Is the law for the flux in the river.

The discharge rate $Q$ in a river as a function of the water depth.
```

This provides a reasonable simplified model for the flow in many rivers, for example the chart above compares this formula with data from the River Severn showing flow as a function of the water depth.

An initial result emerging from this model is that if the level of the banks are at $z = h^*$ above the base of the river, then the critical flow rate of water in the river above which it begins to flood is

```{math}
Q^* = Q(h^*)
```

If we want to use this model for the river flow to reduce the flood we see that the key controls we have are (a) raising the height of the banks; (b) deepening the river; (c) widening the river.

```

Our earlier idealised models for the surface runoff identify how more intense and longer duration rain events lead to a greater flux reaching the river, and hence we can explore the type of rain storm which will lead to the flux exceeding the maximum river flux in terms of the model for the runoff. Given statistics for the distribution of expected rainfall intensity and rainfall duration, it is then possible to design mitigation measures to reduce the flux arriving at the river from the run-off for a given rain storm. There is then a cost benefit analysis to be carried out to determine the benefit of mitigating the flood risk for different intensity storms : this involves estimating the costs of the mitigation measures compared to the costs of the damage produced by the flooding multiplied by the risk of the flooding. 

## Coupled Model

If we combine the runoff model with the river model we find the following comparison plot, illustrating how different types of rainfall lead to different flow regimes (ie flooding or not)

This model, although simplified, has features in common with the classical river hydrograph ({numref}`hydrograph`) in which we plot the rainfall flux and the river flow rate as a function of time.
