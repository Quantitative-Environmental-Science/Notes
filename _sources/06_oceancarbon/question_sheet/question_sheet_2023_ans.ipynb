    "1. What are the three main processes that interact with ocean circulation to set the concentration and distribution of carbon in the ocean. Describe how DIC, TA and pCO2 change in response to these processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Broadly, mixing processes in the ocean work to homogenise the ocean, while three chemical and biolgical 'Pumps' work to distribute carbon unevenly between the boxes. Those pumps are: \n",
    "> 1. The Solubility Pump, which describes the concentration of carbon in the deep ocean driven by the temperature dependence of gas solubility in the surface ocean, which is described by Henry's Law. More CO2 can dissolve into cold water than warm water, so cold, dense water sinking in downwelling regions has the highest CO2 concentration, which is transferred to the deep ocean. When this water eventually upwells and warms, it degases CO2 to the atmosphere. This explains first-order patterns of CO2 uptake and release in the ocean (uptake in regions with cooling water, release in upwelling regions with warming water). The solubility pump is 'amplified' by the speciation of DIC in seawater. CO2 reacts with water to form aqueous species HCO3- and CO32-, which do not exchange with the atmosphere. At normal surface water pH, only around 0.5% of the DIC pool exists as dissolved CO2, so the water holds around ~200 times more dissolved carbon that predicted by CO2 solubility alone. The action of the solubility pump causes CO2 to be elevated in the deep ocean, thus removing carbon from the atmosphere compared to a homogeneous well-mixed ocean.\n",
    "> 2. The Biological Pump, which describes the uptake of carbon into organic matter by photosynthesis, which is then exported into the deep ocean. Biological productivity in the surface ocean is limited by the availability of light and nutrients. The primary limiting nutrients are the macronutrients N and P, although micronutrients like Fe and Zn can be important in some regions, particularly the southern ocean. The stoichiometry of organic matter is approximately 106C:16N:P, which means that for each mole of P exported from the surface ocean, 106 carbon travel with it. This creates a uni-directional flux of particulate carbon which leaves the surface ocean and is 'remineralised' back into deep water as it is broken down by bacteria. The biological pump acts to remove carbon from the atmosphere and concentrate it in the deep ocean.\n",
    "> 3. The Carbonate Pump, which describes the formation and sinking of CaCO3 particles in the surface ocean. The production of calcium carbonate in the surface is biologcially mediated, primarily by coccolithophores, foraminifera and pteropods in the open ocean. Once the particles leave the surface ocean, changes in pressure destabilise the mineral, while reductions in [CO3] caused by a combination of pressure and organic matter remineralisation in the deep waters causes deep waters to become undersaturated with respect to CaCO3 (Î© < 1), causing the mineral to dissolve in the deep ocean. Calcification removes CO3 from the surface ocean, which causes DIC speciation to shift towards CO2, causing the release of CO2 to the atmosphere. Thus even though calcificatoin exports DIC from the surface, it also causes CO2 release to the atmosphere. This can also be considered in terms of the exporting DIC and TA in a 1:2 ratio. "
